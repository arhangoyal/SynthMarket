# group_09_project <br> \<market-simulator-generator> <br> Adaptive Synthetic Data Generation for Algorithm Testing in Financial Markets

Testing trading algorithms in financial markets requires data that represents realistic and diverse market conditions. However, relying on historical data has limitations: it is often expensive, biased, and inflexible for evolving algorithm needs. Synthetic data provides an alternative, but traditional methods lack adaptability and realism.
